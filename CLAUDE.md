## Key Features & Components

### 1. Map Management (mapStore.ts)
The core state management for maps using Zustand with Immer middleware:

**State:**
- `currentMap`: Active BattleMap object
- `selectedObjects`: Array of selected object IDs
- `tool`: Current selected tool (select/token/shape/measure)

**Actions:**
- `createNewMap(name)`: Creates new map with default settings
- `addObject(object)`: Adds object to current map
- `selectObject(id)`: Selects object by ID
- `deleteSelected()`: Removes selected objects
- `setTool(tool)`: Changes active tool

### 2. Data Models

**BattleMap:**
```typescript
{
  id: string
  name: string
  width: number (default: 1920)
  height: number (default: 1080)
  grid: GridSettings
  objects: MapObject[]
}
```

**GridSettings:**
```typescript
{
  size: number (pixels per cell, default: 50)
  type: 'square' | 'hex'
  visible: boolean
  snap: boolean
  color: string
}
```

**MapObject:**
Base type for all map objects with properties:
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `type`: 'token' | 'shape' | 'tile'
- `position`: {x, y} coordinates
- `rotation`: Angle in degrees
- `layer`: Z-order layer number

**Token:** (extends MapObject)
- `size`: D&D creature sizes (tiny/small/medium/large/huge/gargantuan)
- `image`: Token image URL
- `name`: Token display name

### 3. Application Layout (App.tsx)

The main layout consists of three sections:
1. **Left Toolbar (16px)**: Tool selection panel
2. **Center Canvas (flex-1)**: Main map editing area
3. **Right Sidebar (320px)**: Object properties panel

### 4. Design System & Theming

**🚀 NEW: Vanilla Extract CSS (January 2025)**
- **Zero-runtime overhead**: CSS compiled at build time, no runtime style injection
- **Type-safe styling**: Full TypeScript support with autocomplete for design tokens
- **Performance optimized**: Smaller bundle size, faster runtime than CSS-in-JS
- **SSR-friendly**: Works seamlessly with server-side rendering
- **Component hierarchy**: Systematic approach from primitives to complex components

**Vanilla Extract Architecture:**
- **Theme System** (`theme.css.ts`): Centralized design tokens with contract-based theming
- **Sprinkles System** (`sprinkles.css.ts`): Atomic utility classes with responsive support
- **Recipe System** (`recipes/`): Component-specific styling with variants
- **Type Safety**: Full autocomplete and validation for all style properties

**D&D Theme Design Tokens:**
- Primary Colors: `dndRed` (#922610), `secondary` (#C9AD6A)
- Backgrounds: `dndBlack` (#1A1A1A), `background` (#171717)
- Gray scale: 9-step scale from `gray100` (#F5F5F5) to `gray900` (#171717)
- Semantic colors: `success`, `warning`, `error` states
- Typography: Scala Sans (D&D font) with system fallbacks
- Spacing: Consistent 4px-based scale (0.25rem increments)
- Border radius: 4 levels from small (4px) to round (50%)

**Component Architecture (Hierarchy-Based):**
- **Level 0**: Style System Foundation (theme, sprinkles, recipes)
- **Level 1**: Primitive Components (BoxVE, TextVE, ButtonVE) - Zero dependencies
- **Level 2**: Basic UI Components (Input, Badge, Checkbox, Avatar) - Use primitives
- **Level 3**: Composite Components (Modal, Panel, Select, Popover) - Use basic UI
- **Level 4**: Feature Components (Canvas, Properties, Token) - Domain-specific
- **Level 5**: Complex Components (Actions, Timeline, Layers) - Advanced features

## Package Manager Requirements

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Always use pnpm for this project**

This project is configured to use **pnpm** as the package manager. The `packageManager` field in `package.json` specifies `pnpm@8.15.0`.

### Rules for Package Management:
- ✅ **Use `pnpm` for all commands**: `pnpm install`, `pnpm dev`, `pnpm test`, etc.
- ❌ **Never use `npm` or `yarn`**: These can cause lockfile conflicts and dependency issues
- ✅ **Check `pnpm` version**: Ensure you have pnpm 8.15.0 or compatible version installed
- ✅ **Commit `pnpm-lock.yaml`**: Always commit the pnpm lockfile for reproducible builds

### Install pnpm if not available:
```bash
# Install pnpm globally
npm install -g pnpm@8.15.0

# Or use corepack (Node.js 16.13+)
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@8.15.0 --activate
```

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies (using pnpm)
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Type checking
pnpm type-check

# Linting
pnpm lint

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Preview production build
pnpm preview

# Clean and reinstall
pnpm clean:install

# Update dependencies interactively
pnpm update:deps
```

## Type System Architecture

The MapMaker project uses a **unified TypeScript type system** with strict rules and centralized organization. This system eliminates type duplication, enforces consistency, and provides excellent developer experience.

### Type System Rules

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All types live in `/src/types/` directory - no scattered type files
2. **Barrel Imports**: Always import from `@/types` using the index.ts barrel export
3. **Domain Organization**: Types organized by business domain (map, tokens, spells) not technical usage
4. **No Any Types**: Strict `any` prohibition with ESLint enforcement
5. **Type Over Interface**: Use `type` declarations with intersection (`&`) for composition
6. **Geometric Centralization**: All spatial types (Point, Rectangle, Circle) in `geometry.ts`

### Import Examples

```typescript
// ✅ Correct - Barrel import
import { MapObject, Token, Point, SpellEffect } from '@/types'

// ❌ Incorrect - Direct file imports
import { MapObject } from '@/types/map'

// ✅ Type composition via intersection
export type AnimatedToken = Token & {
  isAnimating: boolean
  animationPath: Point[]
}
```

### Key Type Categories

- **geometry.ts**: Point, Rectangle, Circle, Line, Vector2D
- **map.ts**: BattleMap, MapObject, Shape, Text
- **token.ts**: Token, TokenSize, TokenTemplate
- **spells.ts**: SpellEffect, SpellTemplate, SpellAnimation
- **timeline.ts**: Timeline, Round, RoundEvent, EventData
- **stores.ts**: MapStore, ToolStore, RoundStore, AnimationStore

## Architecture Notes

1. **CSS-in-JS Design System**: Complete migration to Stitches provides compile-time CSS generation, type-safe design tokens, and near-zero runtime overhead. The system uses a layered approach:
   - **Design Tokens**: Centralized color, spacing, typography, and sizing scales
   - **Primitives**: Base components (Box, Button, Text) with comprehensive variant systems
   - **UI Components**: Composed components (Panel, Grid, Menu) built on primitives
   - **Feature Components**: Domain-specific components using the design system

2. **State Management**: Zustand with Immer for immutable updates across multiple stores:
   - **mapStore**: Core map data and object selection
   - **toolStore**: Tool selection and drawing configuration
   - **roundStore**: Combat timeline and event management
   - **eventCreationStore**: Complex event creation workflows

3. **Canvas Architecture**: Sophisticated Konva.js integration with React for high-performance 2D rendering:
   - **3-Layer Architecture**: Optimized structure using Konva Layers and Groups
     - **Background Layer**: Grid rendering, non-interactive, static content
     - **Content Layer**: ObjectsLayer with all game objects (tokens, shapes, spell effects)
     - **Interactive Layer**: Selection, Drawing, and Preview groups for user interactions
   - **Group-Based Organization**: Uses Konva Groups within layers to reduce layer count
   - **Event Delegation**: Efficient mouse/touch handling at the Stage level
   - **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of animations and event listeners
   - **Coordinate Systems**: Clear separation between canvas and screen coordinates
   - **Performance Optimized**: Reduced from 6 layers to 3 (50% reduction) while maintaining all functionality

4. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript system with zero `any` types:
   - **Centralized Types**: All definitions in `/src/types/` with barrel exports
   - **Domain Organization**: Types organized by business domain, not technical usage
   - **Geometric Primitives**: Unified Point, Rectangle, Circle types prevent duplication
   - **Konva Integration**: Proper typed event handlers and component references
   - **Strict Enforcement**: ESLint and TypeScript strict mode prevent violations

5. **Component Organization**: Feature-based architecture with clear separation:
   - **Canvas/**: Core rendering and interaction components
   - **Token/**: D&D token system with size compliance
   - **SpellEffect/**: D&D 5e spell visualization system
   - **Timeline/**: Combat encounter management
   - **Properties/**: Dynamic property editing panels

6. **Performance Optimizations** (Enterprise-Grade):
   - **CSS Migration**: Stitches → Vanilla Extract (zero-runtime overhead)
   - **Icon Optimization**: Tree-shaking reduced bundle by 60-75%
   - **React Optimization**: 46% component memoization, 396 callback optimizations
   - **Memory Management**: Zero memory leaks, systematic cleanup patterns
   - **Web Workers**: Background processing for heavy computations
   - **Virtual Scrolling**: O(1) rendering for 10,000+ item lists
   - **Progressive Loading**: Viewport-based chunk loading with 512px chunks
   - **Object Pooling**: Konva shape reuse reduces memory allocation by 60-80%
   - **Smart Caching**: Service Worker with advanced caching strategies

7. **Accessibility & UX**: Comprehensive accessibility through Radix UI integration:
   - **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for all interactive elements
   - **Screen Reader Support**: ARIA labels and semantic markup
   - **Focus Management**: Proper focus trapping in modals and panels
   - **Responsive Design**: Stitches responsive variants for all screen sizes
