# Token Animation Fix Summary

## Problem
Token animations were not working visually - animations would execute but tokens wouldn't move on the canvas. Debug logs showed:
- "Found token node, type: Group"
- "Token position: 0 0" (incorrect - should be actual position)
- "Tween started" (animation initiated)
- But no visual change on the map

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the token rendering structure in `ObjectsLayer.tsx`:

### Before (Broken):
```jsx
<Group key={token.id} id={token.id}>  // Outer Group with ID but no position
  <Token
    token={token}  // Inner Token component with position
    ...
  />
</Group>
```

The animation hook was finding the outer Group by ID, but this Group had position 0,0 because the actual position was set on the inner Token component's Group.

### Token Component Structure:
```jsx
// Inside Token component
<Group
  x={token.position.x}  // Position set here
  y={token.position.y}
  ...
>
  {/* Token shapes */}
</Group>
```

## Solution
Move the position to the outer Group that has the ID:

### After (Fixed):
```jsx
<Group
  key={token.id}
  id={token.id}
  x={token.position.x}      // Position now on outer Group with ID
  y={token.position.y}
  rotation={token.rotation}
  draggable={...}
  onDragMove={...}
  onDragEnd={...}
>
  <Token
    token={{...token, position: {x: 0, y: 0}, rotation: 0}}  // Inner at 0,0
    isDraggable={false}  // Dragging handled by parent
    ...
  />
</Group>
```

## Files Modified
1. **src/components/Canvas/ObjectsLayer.tsx** - Fixed token rendering structure

## Test Coverage Added
1. **useTokenAnimation.test.ts** - Unit tests for animation logic
2. **useTokenAnimation.integration.test.ts** - Integration tests identifying the position issue
3. **useTokenAnimation.visual.test.ts** - Visual animation verification tests

## Key Insights from Tests
The tests revealed that:
- Konva Groups often have position 0,0 by default
- The `x()` and `y()` methods on Groups return 0 unless explicitly set
- Position might be stored in `attrs.x/y` or via `getAbsolutePosition()`
- The animation system was working correctly but operating on the wrong node

## Verification
After the fix:
- Tokens are found with their correct positions (not 0,0)
- Animations execute and visually update token positions
- Dragging still works correctly as it's handled by the outer Group
- All token visual features (labels, conditions, etc.) remain functional

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues:
1. Always set the ID on the same element that has the position
2. When wrapping components, be explicit about where transforms are applied
3. Use integration tests that verify actual position values, not just method calls
4. Debug with extensive logging of position retrieval methods
